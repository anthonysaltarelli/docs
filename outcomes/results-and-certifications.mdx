The **Results & Certifications** page is where you see all outcome records for your organization and record, edit, or export them.

## Where to find it

In the Program Dashboard sidebar, go to **Outcomes** → **Results & Certifications**. Or open [Results & Certifications](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/results-and-certifications) directly.

## What you see

When you **select a cohort** in the filter, the top of the page shows summary cards:

- **Graduation rate** — Percentage and count of students who completed the cohort.
- **Attrition rate** — Percentage and count of students who withdrew.
- **Employment rate** — For placement outcomes: percentage and count of graduates who are employed.
- **Still enrolled** — Number of students currently active in the cohort.

Below that is the **Outcome records** table. Each row shows:

- **Student** — Name (click to open the student’s profile).
- **Cohort** — Which cohort the outcome belongs to.
- **Type** — Category: Cohort Progression, Certification Exam, Internal Assessment, or Placement.
- **Subtype** — More specific label (e.g. Completed, Withdrawn, or the name of an exam or assessment).
- **Date** — When the outcome occurred.
- **Result** — Pass/fail for exams and assessments, or the subtype label for progression/placement (e.g. Completed, Withdrawn).
- **Score** — Numeric score if the outcome type uses one.
- **Actions** — Edit, View History, and (for program owners) Delete.

## Filtering

Use the filters above the table to narrow the list:

- **Search** — By student name or email.
- **Cohort** — Show only records for one cohort or all cohorts.
- **Type** — Show only one outcome type (Cohort Progression, Certification Exam, Internal Assessment, or Placement).

Click **Clear filters** to reset.

## Recording one outcome

1. Click **Record Outcome** (top right).
2. Choose **Cohort** and **Student** (only enrolled students in that cohort appear).
3. Choose **Outcome type** and **Subtype** (the list of subtypes depends on the type).
4. Set the **Date** the outcome occurred.
5. Enter the **Result**:
   - For **Cohort Progression** or **Placement**: the result is usually the subtype (e.g. Completed, Withdrawn). If the subtype is a withdrawal, you may be asked for a withdrawal reason (e.g. Financial, Personal, Academic).
   - For **Certification Exam** or **Internal Assessment**: choose Pass or Fail and, if the subtype uses scores, enter the numeric score.
6. Add **Notes** if you want (optional).
7. Click **Save**.

The new record appears in the table.

## Editing an outcome

1. In the outcome record row, open the **Actions** menu (three dots).
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Change the date, subtype, result, score, or notes as needed.
4. Enter a **Reason for change** (this is stored in the record’s history).
5. Save.

## Viewing history

To see who changed an outcome and when:

1. In the row, open the **Actions** menu.
2. Click **View History**.

You’ll see a list of changes (created, updated, or deleted) with who made the change and when.

## Deleting an outcome

Only **program owners** can delete outcome records.

1. In the row, open the **Actions** menu.
2. Click **Delete**.
3. Optionally enter a **Reason for deletion** (stored in history).
4. Confirm.

The record is removed from the table. Deletion is permanent, but the reason is kept in the audit history.

## Export

To download outcome records for use in a spreadsheet or report:

1. Set any **filters** you want (cohort, type, search).
2. Click **Export CSV** (top right).

A file is downloaded with the records that match your current filters (e.g. all records for the selected cohort and type).

## Opening a student’s profile

Clicking a **student name** in the table opens that student’s profile. From there you can view their full record, including the **Outcomes** tab where you can add or view outcomes for that student.
