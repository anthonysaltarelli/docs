**Outcomes** are the results you record for students—for example that they completed a cohort, passed an exam, withdrew, or got a job. Tracking outcomes in one place helps you see what each student has achieved and report on graduation, certification pass rates, and placement.

## Where to go

| Where | What you can do |
|-------|-----------------|
| [**Results & Certifications**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/results-and-certifications) | View and manage all outcome records, record one outcome at a time, filter and export, and edit or view history. |
| [**Outcome Types**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/settings/outcome-subtypes) | Configure the types of outcomes you can record (e.g. exam names, Completed/Withdrawn). Only **program owners** can manage outcome types. |

In the Program Dashboard, both links are in the sidebar under **Outcomes**.

## Other places you can record outcomes

- **From a cohort** — Open [Cohorts](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts), then open a cohort and go to the **Outcomes** tab. There you can add one outcome at a time or use **Record outcomes in bulk** for many students at once (e.g. after a cohort-wide exam).
- **From a student’s profile** — Open a student from the [Students](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/students) list, then go to the **Outcomes** tab and use **Add Outcome Record** or **Record Outcome**. The student is already selected so you only choose cohort, type, subtype, date, and result.
