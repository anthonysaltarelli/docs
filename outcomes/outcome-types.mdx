**Outcome types** are the categories and labels you use when recording an outcome—for example “Completed,” “Withdrawn,” “NREMT,” or “Final Exam.” You manage them on the **Outcome Types** page so they appear when you record outcomes.

## Where to set them

In the Program Dashboard sidebar, go to **Outcomes** → **Outcome Types**. Or open [Outcome Types](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/settings/outcome-subtypes) directly.

Only **program owners** see and can manage this page. Instructors can record outcomes using the types you configure but cannot add or change outcome types.

## What outcome types are

There are four **categories**:

- **Cohort Progression** — Whether a student completed the cohort, withdrew, or is still enrolled (e.g. Completed, Withdrawn).
- **Certification Exam** — External or official exams (e.g. NREMT, state certification).
- **Internal Assessment** — Your own exams or assessments (e.g. Final Exam, Midterm, Skills Check).
- **Placement** — What happened after completion (e.g. Employed, Continuing Education).

Under each category you have **subtypes**—the specific options that appear when you record an outcome. For example, under Certification Exam you might have “NREMT” and “State EMT”; under Cohort Progression you have “Completed” and “Withdrawn.”

## System defaults

For **Cohort Progression** and **Placement**, some subtypes are built-in and shared by all organizations. They appear as **System Default** and cannot be edited or removed. Examples:

- Cohort Progression: Completed, Withdrawn.
- Placement: Employed, Continuing Education, Unknown (or similar).

You can still add **custom** subtypes for these categories if you need extra options (e.g. another placement label). System defaults always stay available.

## Certification Exam and Internal Assessment

For **Certification Exam** and **Internal Assessment**, there are no system defaults that you must use. You add subtypes in one of two ways:

### Explore Options

**Explore Options** shows a list of built-in options (e.g. common certification exams or assessment names). You can search, preview, and add any of them to your organization with one click. Once added, they appear when you record outcomes and you can edit or delete them like any custom subtype.

### Create Custom Subtype

**Create Custom Subtype** lets you define your own:

- **Name** — What you see when recording (e.g. “NREMT Written”).
- **Code** — A short internal identifier (often auto-filled from the name).
- **Scored** — Whether this subtype uses a numeric score (yes/no).
- **Max score** and **Passing score** — If scored, you can set the maximum and the passing threshold.
- **Repeatable** — Whether a student can have more than one record of this subtype (e.g. multiple exam attempts).
- **Accreditation body** — For certification exams, you can optionally link the subtype to an accreditation body (e.g. NREMT).

Save the subtype and it appears under that category when you record outcomes.

## Editing and deleting

- **Custom subtypes** (yours or ones you added from Explore Options) can be **edited** — change the name, code, scored settings, passing score, repeatable, or accreditation body.
- **Custom subtypes** can be **deleted**. Deleting only deactivates the subtype so it no longer appears for new records. Existing outcome records that used it stay valid and visible; you are not asked to reassign them.

System default subtypes cannot be edited or deleted.
