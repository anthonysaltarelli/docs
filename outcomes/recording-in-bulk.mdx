**Recording outcomes in bulk** lets you add outcome records for many students in one go—for example after a cohort-wide exam or assessment when the same type, subtype, and date apply to everyone.

## When to use it

Use bulk recording when:

- Many students in one cohort had the same outcome on the same date (e.g. everyone took the NREMT written exam on March 15).
- You want to set one outcome type and subtype, one date, and then enter each student’s result (pass/fail or score) in a single flow instead of opening “Record Outcome” many times.

If you only need to add one outcome, use **Record Outcome** from [Results & Certifications](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/results-and-certifications) or from the student’s profile instead.

## Where to do it

Bulk recording is **only available from a cohort**. You cannot start it from Results & Certifications or from a student’s profile.

1. Go to [**Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts).
2. Open the cohort you want (e.g. “EMT Basic Fall 2024”).
3. Click the **Outcomes** tab.
4. Click **Record outcomes in bulk**.

The bulk recording panel opens for that cohort.

## Steps

1. **Choose outcome type and subtype**  
   Select the category (e.g. Certification Exam) and the specific subtype (e.g. NREMT Written). Only enrolled students in this cohort are included.

2. **Set the date**  
   Enter the date the outcome occurred (e.g. the exam date). This date is used for every record you create in this bulk flow.

3. **Set each student’s result**  
   You’ll see a list of enrolled students. For each student you can:
   - **Include or exclude** — Leave the student in the list to create a record, or remove them if they didn’t take this exam or assessment.
   - **Result** — For exams and assessments: choose Pass or Fail and, if the subtype uses scores, enter the numeric score. For cohort progression (e.g. Withdrawn): choose the subtype or withdrawal reason as prompted.
   - **Notes** — Optionally add notes for that student.

4. **Submit**  
   Click the button to create all the outcome records at once. Each student you included gets one new record with the shared type, subtype, and date, and their individual result and score.

After submitting, the new records appear in the cohort’s Outcomes tab and on [Results & Certifications](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/results-and-certifications) (filter by that cohort if needed).

## Difference from recording one at a time

| | Single record | Bulk |
|--|----------------|------|
| **Where** | Results & Certifications, a cohort’s Outcomes tab, or a student’s profile | Only a cohort’s Outcomes tab |
| **Use when** | One student, or a few students with different types/dates | Many students, same type and date |

Single records can be added from anywhere you see **Record Outcome** or **Add Outcome Record**. Bulk is only from the cohort **Outcomes** tab via **Record outcomes in bulk**.
