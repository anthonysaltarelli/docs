Program offerings define what students get when they enroll in a cohort (e.g. “EMT Spring 2025”). Assigning **courses** to an offering makes those courses available to everyone enrolled in any cohort that uses that offering.

## How it works

- **Program offering** — A template for a program (name, price, application, etc.). When you create a cohort, you attach it to an offering.
- **Assigned courses** — The list of courses you attach to that offering. Every student enrolled in a cohort under that offering gets access to those courses in the order you set, and you can mark any course as required.

You assign courses when creating or editing the offering. The courses must already exist in your organization’s [Courses](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/courses) list.

## Assigning courses to an offering

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Program Offerings**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/program-offerings).
2. Create a new offering or open an existing one to edit.
3. Find the **Courses** section (or “Courses in this offering”).
4. **Add courses:** Add courses from your organization. Pick from the list of existing courses; they are added to the offering.
5. **Reorder:** Drag courses up or down to set the order students see them (e.g. “Course A” then “Course B”).
6. **Required:** For each course, you can mark it as **Required**. Required courses usually count toward completion or compliance for the program.
7. **Remove:** Use the remove button on a course to remove it from the offering. This does not delete the course; it only removes it from this offering.

Save or confirm the offering when done. The new list applies to all cohorts that use this offering (and to future enrollments).

## Effect on cohorts and students

- **Cohorts** — Each cohort is tied to one offering. The cohort gets the list of courses assigned to that offering.
- **Students** — When a student enrolls in a cohort, they get access to all courses assigned to that cohort’s offering. They see them in their dashboard in the order you set; required courses are indicated as such.

If you change the offering’s course list (add, remove, reorder, or change required), the change applies to that offering and thus to all its cohorts and their enrolled students. You do not assign courses per cohort; you assign them once per offering.

## Assigning vs standalone sales

- **Assigning to an offering** — Gives access to students who **enroll in a cohort** that uses that offering. They get the course as part of the program; no separate purchase.
- **Standalone course** — Sold or given **without enrollment**. Students get access by purchasing (or claiming) the course directly. See [Standalone courses](/courses/standalone-courses).

A single course can be both: assigned to one or more offerings (for enrolled students) and enabled for standalone purchase (for anyone who buys it separately).

## Where to find it

- **Program offerings:** [Program Dashboard → Program Offerings](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/program-offerings).
- **Courses section:** Open an offering to create or edit; the Courses section is on that page.
