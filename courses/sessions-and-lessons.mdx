Cohorts have a **schedule** made of **sessions** (e.g. “Week 1 – Monday 9am,” “Skills Lab – Wednesday”). You can attach **lessons** to specific sessions so students know which lessons are intended for which date and so the schedule shows a clear plan.

## Course in offering vs lesson on session

- **Course in offering** — Determines *which courses* a student gets when they enroll in a cohort. You set this when you [assign courses to the program offering](/courses/assigning-to-offerings). Every student in that cohort has access to those courses and their modules and lessons.
- **Lesson on session** — Determines *when* a lesson appears on the cohort’s schedule. You assign lessons to sessions so that, for example, “Vital Signs” is linked to “Week 1 – Monday.” This is for planning and display; students can still open lessons from the course view even if they are not linked to a session.

So: the offering defines *what* courses (and thus lessons) exist for the cohort; session assignment defines *which* lessons are tied to *which* sessions on the calendar.

## Assigning lessons to sessions

1. Open the **cohort** (e.g. from Program Dashboard → Cohorts).
2. Go to the cohort’s **schedule** or **sessions** view.
3. Open the **session–lesson assignment** panel (e.g. “Assign lessons” or the panel that lists sessions and lessons).
4. For a given session (or in a view that shows all sessions), select which **lessons** from the cohort’s courses should be linked to that session. Lessons come from the courses that are assigned to the cohort’s offering.
5. Save. The schedule then shows those lessons under the corresponding sessions.

You can assign multiple lessons to one session and leave some sessions with no lessons. Revisit this whenever you change the schedule or add new lessons.

## How students see it

- **Course view** — Students see their courses and can open any lesson and complete content regardless of session assignment.
- **Schedule view** — Students see sessions on the calendar; sessions that have lessons assigned show those lessons (e.g. “Vital Signs,” “Patient Assessment”). This helps them follow the intended plan.

Completion and progress are tracked per lesson; linking a lesson to a session doesn’t change how completion is tracked.

## Where to find it

- **Cohorts:** [Program Dashboard → Cohorts](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts).
- **Session–lesson assignment:** From a cohort, open its schedule or sessions and use the option to assign lessons to sessions (e.g. “Assign lessons to session”).

To record what was taught and by whom (teaching topics, duration, instructors), use **Manage Session** on a session, then the **Teaching** tab. See [Session segments (Manage Teaching)](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/session-segments) for details.
