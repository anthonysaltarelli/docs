This guide covers creating a course, editing its settings (title, description, estimated hours, completion, prerequisites), and when to use course settings versus the course builder.

## Creating a course

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Courses**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/courses).
2. Click **Create Course**.
3. In the dialog, enter:
   - **Title** (required)
   - **Description** (optional)
4. Click **Create**. The course is created and you are taken to the **Course Builder** to add modules and lessons.

You can add modules and lessons right away or return later from the Courses list by opening the course and choosing **Course Builder**.

## Course settings (edit course)

Course settings control the course as a whole: how it’s described, what counts as “complete,” and whether it can be sold on its own. To edit them:

- From the Courses list: open a course, then use **Edit Course Settings** (or the settings or gear icon on the course).
- From the Course Builder: click **Edit Course Settings** in the header.

You can edit:

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Title** | Display name of the course. |
| **Description** | Summary or overview; shown on the course page and in lists. |
| **Estimated hours** | Optional. How long the course typically takes (e.g. for display or planning). |
| **Completion threshold** | Percentage of required content students must complete for the course to count as complete (e.g. 100%). |
| **Required** | Whether the course is required in contexts where it’s used (e.g. in an offering). |
| **Prerequisite course** | Optional. Another course that must be completed before this one (when both are in the same offering or purchase path). |

Standalone sale options (sell without enrollment) are also in course settings; they are described in [Standalone courses](/courses/standalone-courses).

## Course management vs course builder

- **Course settings / course management** — Title, description, estimated hours, completion threshold, required, prerequisite course, and standalone sale options. Use this when you want to change how the course is described or how it behaves at the “course” level.
- **Course builder** — Structure (modules and lessons) and, via the lesson editor, the actual content (videos, text, resources). Use this when you want to add or reorder modules/lessons or edit lesson content.

You do not edit module or lesson content from the main course settings screen; open the Course Builder and then the lesson editor for that.

## Deleting a course

From the Courses list, you can delete a course. You can only delete a course when it’s not in use—for example, not assigned to any program offering and not set up for standalone sale. If you see a message that deletion isn’t allowed, remove the course from offerings or turn off standalone sales first, then delete.

## Where to find it

- **Courses list:** [Program Dashboard → Courses](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/courses)
- **Course Builder:** Open a course from the list, then **Course Builder** (or use the link you get right after creating the course).
