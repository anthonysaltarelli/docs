Courses are organized in a two-level structure: **modules** (sections) and **lessons** (units inside a module). You manage this structure in the Course Builder.

## Hierarchy

- **Course** — The top-level container (e.g. “EMT Continuing Education”).
- **Module** — A section within the course (e.g. “Week 1: Patient Assessment”). Each module has a title, optional description, order, and can be required.
- **Lesson** — A single learning unit inside a module (e.g. “Vital Signs”). Each lesson has a title, optional description, order, required flag, and holds the actual content (videos, text, resources).

You control the order of modules and lessons. You can reorder them by dragging in the Course Builder.

## Managing modules

### Adding a module

1. Open the course in the [Course Builder](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/courses) (open a course, then **Course Builder**).
2. In the **Course Structure** area, click **Add Module**.
3. Enter the module **title** and, if you want, a **description**. You can also set **Required**.

### Editing a module

Click the module’s edit button in the Course Builder. You can change:

- **Title**
- **Description**
- **Required** — Whether the module is required for course completion.

### Reordering modules

In the Course Builder, use the module’s drag handle to move it up or down. The new order is saved automatically. Lesson order within each module is independent.

### Deleting a module

Use the module’s delete button in the Course Builder. Deleting a module removes it and all its lessons and content. This cannot be undone.

## Managing lessons

### Adding a lesson

1. In the Course Builder, expand the module you want.
2. Click **Add Lesson** for that module.
3. Enter the lesson **title** and, if you want, a **description**. You can set **Required** as needed.

### Editing a lesson’s title and description

To change a lesson’s title, description, or whether it’s required:

- Click the lesson in the Course Builder to open the **Lesson editor**. At the top you can edit the title, description, and required setting.
- Or use the lesson’s edit button if you see one in the builder.

To add or change the lesson’s **content** (videos, text, PDFs, etc.), use the same lesson editor; see [Content and media](/courses/content-and-media).

### Reordering lessons

Lessons are ordered within their module. In the Course Builder, use the lesson’s drag handle to move it up or down within that module. Order is saved automatically.

### Deleting a lesson

Use the lesson’s delete button. Deleting a lesson removes it and all its content and resources. This cannot be undone.

## Lesson types (video, text, mixed)

The platform automatically labels each lesson based on the content you add:

- **Video** — The lesson is all video (e.g. videos uploaded to First Responders Hub or video links).
- **Text** — The lesson is all text (e.g. rich text).
- **Mixed** — The lesson has a mix of video, text, or other types (e.g. PDF, embed, file).

You don’t set the type yourself; it updates as you add or remove content. This helps you and students tell “video” lessons from “reading” lessons at a glance.

## Where to find it

- **Course Builder:** [Program Dashboard → Courses](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/courses) → open a course → **Course Builder**.
- **Lesson editor:** From the Course Builder, click a lesson to open it and add or edit content.
