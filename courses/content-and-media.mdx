Lesson content is added in the **lesson editor**. Each lesson can have multiple pieces of content (videos, text, PDFs, embeds, etc.) and optional **resources** (files or links) for download or reference.

## Content types

You can add these types of content to a lesson:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Uploaded video** | Video uploaded through the platform and hosted on First Responders Hub. Best for reliable playback and progress tracking. |
| **Video URL** | Link to a video hosted elsewhere. |
| **YouTube video** | Embed a YouTube video by URL. |
| **Vimeo video** | Embed a Vimeo video by URL. |
| **Rich text** | Formatted text (headings, lists, links, etc.) written in the editor. |
| **PDF URL** | Link to a PDF (e.g. hosted on your site or elsewhere). |
| **Embed URL** | Content from another website shown inside the lesson (e.g. an interactive or embedded page). |
| **File upload** | File stored and linked from the lesson (e.g. document or image). |

Content has an **order** within the lesson. You can change the order by dragging in the lesson editor. Students see and complete them in that order.

## Uploading videos

Videos you upload are stored on First Responders Hub and prepared so students can stream them.

1. In the lesson editor, click **Add content** and choose **Video** (or the option that creates an upload).
2. Select the video file. The browser uploads it to the platform.
3. The page will show **Processing** while the video is being prepared. This can take a few minutes depending on the video’s length and size.
4. When processing is complete, the video shows as **Ready** and students can play it. How far they’ve watched is saved so they can pick up where they left off.

- **While it’s processing** — You can leave the page and come back; the video will show as ready when it’s done.
- **For students** — Videos play securely on the platform so only enrolled or authorized students can view them.

If you prefer not to upload a file, you can add a **Video URL**, **YouTube**, or **Vimeo** link instead and paste the URL.

## Adding other content

- **Text** — Choose the rich text option and type or paste. Use the toolbar for formatting and links.
- **PDF / embed / file** — Choose the matching type and enter a URL or upload a file as prompted. For file uploads, the file is stored and linked from the lesson.

You can mix types in one lesson (e.g. a short video plus a text summary plus a PDF). Reorder items by dragging.

## Lesson resources (files and links)

In addition to content items, a lesson can have **resources**: files or links meant for download or reference (e.g. handout PDF, external form).

- **File** — Upload a file; it’s stored and students can download it.
- **Link** — Provide a URL; students open it in a new tab or copy it.

Resources are listed separately from the main content items (e.g. in a “Resources” area in the lesson editor and on the student view). They have a display name and order.

## Reordering and removing content

- **Reorder:** In the lesson editor, drag content (and resources) to change the order. Changes save automatically.
- **Remove:** Use the delete or remove button on the piece of content or resource. Removing it deletes it from the lesson.

## Where to find it

- **Lesson editor:** [Program Dashboard → Courses](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/courses) → open a course → **Course Builder** → click a lesson.
- Content and resources are managed on the same screen.
