When you add a section to an application form, you can start from a **section template**. Templates are pre-built sets of sections with suggested titles, descriptions, and fields (including field types and, where relevant, profile mapping). You can use them as-is or edit the section and fields after adding.

## Where to find this

When [editing an application form](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/applications), click **Add Section** (or the equivalent). A **Select a Section Template** dialog lists the available templates. Choose one to preview its fields, then click **Use Template** to add it to your form. You can reorder sections and edit or remove any field.

## Available templates

### Student Information

- **Template type:** `student_info`
- **Purpose:** Basic contact and personal information.
- **Typical fields:** First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Date of Birth, Gender (select), Shirt Size (select). Many of these are set up with [profile field mapping](/enrollment/applications-profile-mapping) so they sync to the student’s profile (e.g. first name, last name, email, phone).
- **Use when:** You want a standard “about the applicant” block that can also update the student profile.

### Mailing Address

- **Template type:** `mailing_address`
- **Purpose:** Mailing and billing address.
- **Typical fields:** Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State (dropdown of US state codes), ZIP Code (with validation), and an optional “Use this address for billing” checkbox. Address fields are mapped to profile address fields where applicable.
- **Use when:** You need a full address for mailings, billing, or records.

### Screening Questions

- **Template type:** `screening_questions`
- **Purpose:** Pre-enrollment yes/no or short screening questions.
- **Typical fields:** Radio questions such as “Do you have a valid driver’s license?”, “Are you at least 18 years of age?”, “Do you have a high school diploma or GED?”, “Have you been convicted of a felony?”, “Are you currently employed?” (optional). Options are typically “Yes” / “No”.
- **Use when:** You want a quick screening block; you can edit the questions and options to match your program.

### Additional Information

- **Template type:** `additional_info`
- **Purpose:** Extra details and comments.
- **Typical fields:** Certification Number (text), County (text), “How did you hear about us?” (select), Referral Source Details (text), Additional Comments (textarea). No profile mapping by default.
- **Use when:** You want a catch-all section for optional or program-specific info.

### Custom Section

- **Template type:** `custom`
- **Purpose:** Empty section; you add all fields yourself.
- **Use when:** None of the pre-built templates fit; you define the section title, description, required/optional, and every field and its type.

## System vs custom templates

The templates above are **system templates**: they are built in and available to all organizations. When you “use” a template, a **copy** of that section (and its fields) is added to your form. Changing your form does not change the template; the template stays the same for future forms.

Organizations do not create or delete system templates. You only choose a template when adding a section, then edit the resulting section and fields as needed (e.g. add/remove fields, change labels, set required, or add profile mapping).

## After adding a template

- Reorder the section by dragging it in the form editor.
- Edit the section title or description.
- Toggle **Required section** for that section.
- Add, edit, reorder, or remove fields.
- For any field, set **Auto-fill from User Profile** (profile field mapping) if you want that value to [sync to the student profile](/enrollment/applications-profile-mapping).

So templates are a starting point; the form you build is fully editable.
