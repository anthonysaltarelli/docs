---

When a student completes enrollment (after successful payment or free enrollment), two emails are sent automatically: one to the student and one to the program owner. You do not need to turn these on; they are part of the enrollment confirmation flow.

## When the emails are sent

Both emails are sent **as soon as enrollment is confirmed**. That happens when:

- The student completes payment (full or deposit), or
- The student completes a free enrollment (no payment).

There is no separate setting to enable or disable these emails; they are sent every time an enrollment is confirmed.

## Student confirmation email

- **Who receives it:** The student (at the email address they used to enroll).
- **What it contains:**
  - Confirmation that they are enrolled (or that their event registration is confirmed, for event-type offerings).
  - Program name and cohort name.
  - Cost and date paid.
  - Confirmation number (for your and their records).
  - Cohort start and end dates.
  - Program location.
  - Your organization’s contact email and phone (so they know who to reach out to).
  - A link to the student dashboard.

The exact wording varies slightly for **programs** vs **events** (e.g. “Enrollment confirmed” vs “Event registration confirmed”), but the information above is always included.

## Admin notification email

- **Who receives it:** The **program owner** for the organization (the user who can access Agreements and full program settings).
- **What it contains:**
  - Notice that a new student has enrolled.
  - Student name and email.
  - Program name and cohort name.
  - Cost and date paid.
  - Confirmation number.
  - Cohort start and end dates.
  - Program location.
  - Organization contact details.
  - A link to the program dashboard so you can view the student or enrollment details.

This gives you a quick summary of each new enrollment without logging in.

## What you can't configure (for these emails)

- You cannot turn the student confirmation or admin notification on or off in the dashboard.
- You cannot change the content or layout of these emails from the app (e.g. add custom fields or change wording). The platform uses the data from the enrollment and offering (program name, cohort, cost, dates, contact info) to fill the templates.

## After enrollment: what students see

In addition to the confirmation email, students see:

- The **enrollment confirmation page** right after they complete enrollment. It can show your **welcome message** and **next steps** if you configured them in the program offering’s [Post-Enrollment Instructions](/enrollment/program-offerings-settings#post-enrollment-instructions).
- The **student dashboard**, where the same welcome message and next steps can appear. They can also complete any **post-enrollment** application form from the dashboard if you assigned one to the offering.

So the confirmation email is the main “receipt” and summary; the confirmation page and dashboard carry your custom post-enrollment instructions and tasks.
