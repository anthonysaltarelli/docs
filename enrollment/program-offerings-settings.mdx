Program offering settings control how students enroll and what they see before and after payment. This page describes the settings that directly affect enrollment: required agreements, required applications, post-enrollment instructions, what’s included & costs, and payment configuration.

## Where to configure

Go to [**Program Dashboard → Program Offerings**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/program-offerings), open an offering, and select the **Settings** tab. Use the left sidebar to switch between sections. Click **Update Program Offering** at the bottom to save changes (except where noted).

## Required Agreements

- **What it is:** The list of agreements students must accept during enrollment for this offering.
- **How to set:** In the sidebar, open **Required Agreements**. Check each published agreement you want to require. You can select multiple agreements.
- **Student experience:** During enrollment, students see each selected agreement and must accept all of them before continuing. See [Agreements](/enrollment/agreements) for creating and publishing agreements.

## Required Applications

- **What it is:** The single application form required for this offering, and when the student completes it.
- **How to set:** In the sidebar, open **Required Applications**. Select one application form and choose **Application timing**: Needs approval (submit first, then you approve before checkout), As part of enrollment (filled during the flow), or Post-enrollment (completed after payment).
- **Student experience:** Depends on timing: pre-approval blocks checkout until you approve; during enrollment shows the form in the flow; post-enrollment lets them complete it from the student dashboard after they’re enrolled. See [Applications](/enrollment/applications) for forms and submissions.

## Post-Enrollment Instructions

- **What it is:** A welcome message and a list of “next steps” (e.g. complete forms, bring documents, join a group) shown to students after they enroll.
- **How to set:** In the sidebar, open **Post-Enrollment Instructions**.
  - **Welcome message (optional):** Text shown on the enrollment confirmation page and in the student dashboard. Use it to thank them and set expectations.
  - **Next steps:** Add steps with a **title** (required), optional **description**, and optional **link** (must start with `http://` or `https://`). Drag to reorder. Students see these in the order you set.
- **Student experience:** After payment (or free enrollment), the confirmation page and dashboard show the welcome message and the ordered list of next steps. Links open in a new tab.

## What's Included & Costs

- **What it is:** Line items that describe what’s included in the offering and any extra costs (e.g. materials, fees). Shown to students during or after enrollment.
- **How to set:** In the sidebar, open **What's Included & Costs**. Add items with a category (e.g. tuition, materials, other), title, optional description, and either a price or a pricing note (e.g. “Included” or “TBD”). You can reorder items by dragging.
- **Student experience:** Students see this breakdown so they understand what they’re paying for and what’s included.

## Payment Configuration

- **What it is:** Tuition amount and how students can pay: full payment upfront, deposit with balance due later, or enrollment without payment. Also when the balance is due (relative to cohort start or end).
- **How to set:** In the sidebar, open **Payment Configuration**. Set the **Tuition amount** (use 0 for a free offering). For paid offerings, enable one or more of: **Allow full payment upfront**, **Allow deposit** (and deposit amount), **Allow enrollment without payment**. Set **Invoice due date** reference (days before cohort start or end) and the number of days.
- **Student experience:** During enrollment, students see the options you enabled (e.g. “Pay in full” or “Pay deposit”) and complete payment or choose “Enroll without payment” if allowed. Balance due is invoiced later per your due-date rules.

Full details (full vs deposit vs no payment, balance due rules, currency) are in [Payment configurations](/payment-settings/payment-configurations).

## Other offering settings

The same offering page includes other sections that support the program but are not enrollment-specific:

- **Program Information** — Name, description, template, modality, status.
- **Full Description** — Rich description for the public program/offering page.
- **Location & Logistics** — Location and schedule type.
- **Courses** — Which courses are part of this offering and their order.
- **Promo Codes** — Promo codes scoped to this offering (see [Coupons](/payment-settings/coupons)).
- **FAQs** — Frequently asked questions for the offering.
- **Feedback & Reviews** — Feedback and review settings for the offering.

You can configure these in the same Settings tab; they do not change the enrollment flow steps described above.
