Agreements are documents (e.g. program policies, liability waivers, or terms) that students must accept during enrollment. You create and publish them in one place, then choose which ones are required for each program offering.

## Where to find this

Go to [**Program Dashboard → Agreements**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/agreements). Only **program owners** can access this page.

## Agreement statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| **Draft** | Saved but not visible to students. You can edit and then publish. |
| **Published** | Live. Students see it when the offering requires it. You can still edit; you can also archive it. |
| **Archived** | No longer used. Not listed for assignment to offerings. You can view or delete. |

Only **published** agreements can be assigned to program offerings. Draft and archived agreements do not appear in the offering settings.

## Creating an agreement

1. On the Agreements page, click **Create New Agreement**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Internal name** — A short label for your team (e.g. "EMT Program Policy"). Shown in the agreements list and in program offering settings.
   - **External name** — The title students see when they accept the agreement (e.g. "EMT Program Terms and Policies").
   - **Content** — The full text of the agreement. Use the editor to format and structure the content.
3. Click **Save as draft** to keep it editable, or **Publish** to make it available for assignment.

You can edit a draft or published agreement at any time. Changes to a published agreement apply the next time a student goes through enrollment.

## List actions

From the agreements table you can:

- **View** — Open the agreement in read-only mode.
- **Edit** — Change internal name, external name, or content (draft or published).
- **Publish** — Move a draft to published (so it can be assigned to offerings).
- **Archive** — Move a published agreement to archived (it will no longer be assignable).
- **Duplicate** — Create a copy as a new draft (useful for similar agreements).
- **Delete** — Permanently remove an agreement (typically used for drafts or archived items).

## Assigning agreements to a program offering

Agreements are required **per program offering**, not globally.

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Program Offerings**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/program-offerings).
2. Open the program offering you want to configure.
3. Open the **Settings** tab.
4. In the left sidebar, select **Required Agreements**.
5. Check the published agreements that students must accept for this offering.
6. Click **Update Program Offering** to save.

You can assign multiple agreements to one offering. Students will see each required agreement during enrollment and must accept all of them before continuing.

## What students see

When a student enrolls in a cohort whose program offering has required agreements:

1. During the enrollment flow, an **Agreements** step appears (after sign-in and profile info, and before payment if applicable).
2. Each required agreement is shown with its **external name** and full **content**.
3. The student must check a box to accept each agreement.
4. They cannot proceed to the next step until all required agreements are accepted.

Accepted agreements are stored with the enrollment for your records.
