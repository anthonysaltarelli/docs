You can permanently delete a program offering only when it has no enrollments in any of its cohorts. If it has enrollments, you can set it to **Discontinued** instead so it no longer appears on the public site while keeping the data in your dashboard.

## Where to find it

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Program Offerings**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/program-offerings) and open the offering.
2. Open the **Settings** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Danger Zone**.

The Danger Zone section shows either **Delete program offering** or **Set to Discontinued**, depending on whether the offering has enrollments.

## When you can delete

You’ll see a **Delete program offering** button only when the offering has **no enrollments** in any of its cohorts.

If you delete the offering:

- The program offering and **all of its cohorts** are permanently removed.
- This action **cannot be undone**.

After you confirm, you’ll be taken back to the Program Offerings list.

## When you cannot delete (use Discontinued instead)

If the offering has one or more enrollments (in any cohort), the Danger Zone will not show Delete. Instead you’ll see **Set to Discontinued**.

**What Discontinued does:**

- The offering is **hidden from the public site** (students and visitors no longer see it).
- The offering and its data **remain in your dashboard** so you can keep records, view enrollments, and manage cohorts.

Use **Set to Discontinued** when you want to stop new signups and hide the offering from the public without losing enrollment or cohort data. Deleting is only for offerings that have no enrollments and that you want to remove entirely.
