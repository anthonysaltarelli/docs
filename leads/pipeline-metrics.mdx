At the top of the Leads page, four cards summarize your pipeline: how much potential value you have in active leads, how many leads have converted or were lost, and how many new leads you’ve gotten recently. These numbers help you prioritize follow-up and track progress.

## The four cards

### Active pipeline

- **Top number** — Total value (in dollars) of all leads currently marked **Active**, based on the program tuition for each lead.
- **Subtitle** — “Active pipeline” and the count of active leads.

Use this to see how much potential enrollment value is in your pipeline and how many leads you’re still working. A growing active pipeline may mean you need to dedicate more time to follow-up or that interest is strong.

### Converted

- **Top number** — Count of leads marked **Converted** (enrolled or purchased).
- **Subtitle** — “Converted” and “Successfully enrolled.”

This is your count of leads who became students. Track this over time to see how well you’re converting interest into enrollments.

### Lost

- **Top number** — Count of leads marked **Lost** (no longer pursuing).
- **Subtitle** — “Lost” and “No longer pursuing.”

These are leads you’ve closed out as not enrolling. Keeping this updated (by marking leads Lost when appropriate) keeps your active pipeline accurate and your follow-up list focused.

### New leads

- **Top number** — Number of new leads in the **last 7 days**.
- **Subtitle** — “New leads” and “X last 7 days, Y last 30 days.”

This shows recent interest. A spike in new leads might mean a marketing push or seasonal interest; you can then prioritize responding quickly to those new leads.

## How to use the metrics

- **Follow up on active pipeline** — Use the Leads table filtered to Active to work through your list and update status or add notes.
- **Measure conversion** — Compare Converted count over time and against New leads to see how well you turn interest into enrollments.
- **Keep the pipeline clean** — Mark leads as Converted when they enroll or Lost when they’re no longer interested so the Active pipeline and counts stay meaningful.

Lead value and pipeline totals use the program tuition for each lead when available. Leads tied only to a course (and not a program offering with tuition) may not add to the active pipeline dollar amount, but they still appear in the table and in the lead count.
