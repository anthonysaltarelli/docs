The Leads page shows all leads for your organization in a table. You can filter by status and open any lead to see full details and take action.

## Opening the Leads page

In the program dashboard sidebar, click **Leads**. The page shows pipeline metric cards at the top and the leads table below.

## Table columns

Each row is one lead. The columns show:

- **Date** — When the lead was created
- **Student** — First and last name (a star or badge appears if the lead is on a waitlist)
- **Status** — Active, Converted, or Lost
- **Email** — Click to open your email app
- **Phone** — Click to call
- **Program** — Program or course they asked about or started checkout for
- **Cohort** — Cohort name, if they chose a specific cohort (or “-” if not)
- **Lead value** — Tuition amount for the program, when available
- **Notes** — Number of notes or activities logged (or “-” if none)

## Filter by status

Use the **Filter by Status** dropdown above the table to show:

- **All Statuses** — Every lead
- **Active** — Leads you are still working or following up with
- **Converted** — Leads who enrolled or purchased
- **Lost** — Leads who are no longer pursuing

The table updates to show only leads that match the selected status. The count next to the filter shows how many leads are currently listed.

## Opening lead details

Click any row in the table to open the **lead detail panel** on the right. The panel shows full contact info, status history, notes and activity, waitlist membership, and (when applicable) cart abandonment email status. You can update status, add notes, and add the lead to waitlists from there. Close the panel to return to the table; the list refreshes so any status changes are reflected.
