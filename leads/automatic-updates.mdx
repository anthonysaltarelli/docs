Several things happen automatically when a student completes enrollment or a course purchase. You don’t have to update the lead or cancel emails yourself—the platform does it for you.

## Lead status when a student enrolls or purchases

When a student completes **cohort enrollment** or **course purchase**:

- The platform looks for **active** leads in your organization with the **same email address**.
- Any matching lead is automatically marked **Converted**.
- A note is added to the lead (for example, that they enrolled and the enrollment or confirmation number).

So if someone had requested information or left checkout earlier, their lead will move to Converted as soon as they complete signup. You can still open the lead to see the full history, status history, and the automatic note.

## Cart abandonment emails are cancelled

For leads that came from **cart abandonment**, the platform sends up to three follow-up emails. When that same student completes enrollment or purchase:

- Any **remaining** scheduled follow-up emails for that lead are **automatically cancelled** (marked as skipped or cancelled).
- The student will not receive those emails after they’ve already signed up.

You’ll see in the lead’s **Cart Abandonment Emails** section that those steps were skipped or cancelled. This keeps the experience clean: they get reminders only until they convert.

## Email delivery status

When the platform sends cart abandonment emails, it receives updates from the email provider (e.g. sent, delivered, or failed). Those statuses are updated automatically in the lead panel. You don’t need to do anything; the **Cart Abandonment Emails** section will show the latest status for each step (scheduled, sent, delivered, failed, or cancelled/skipped) as the provider reports back.

## Summary

- **Enrollment or purchase** → Matching active lead(s) are set to Converted and get an automatic note.
- **Cart abandonment lead** → Remaining follow-up emails are cancelled when they enroll or purchase.
- **Email status** → Cart abandonment email status (sent, delivered, failed) updates automatically in the lead panel.

You can focus on following up with active leads; the platform keeps converted leads and email status up to date.
