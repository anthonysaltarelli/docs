Leads are people who asked for information about your programs or who started checkout but did not complete enrollment. The Leads section helps you track and follow up with them.

## Where to find Leads

Go to [**Program Dashboard → Leads**](https://firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/information-requests) in the sidebar. Program owners and instructors can view and manage leads for their organization.

## What you can do

- **View and filter leads** — See all leads in a table and filter by status (Active, Converted, Lost).
- **Open a lead** — Click a row to open the lead detail panel with full contact info, history, and actions.
- **Update status** — Mark leads as Active, Converted (enrolled or purchased), or Lost, with optional notes.
- **Add notes and activity** — Log calls, emails, meetings, or general notes so your team can see the full timeline.
- **Manage waitlists** — Add a lead to one or more cohort waitlists from the lead panel.
- **See cart abandonment emails** — For leads who left checkout, view the status of automated follow-up emails.
- **Review pipeline metrics** — Use the cards at the top (active pipeline value, converted count, lost count, new leads) to track progress.
