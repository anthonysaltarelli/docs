Logging notes and activities on a lead keeps your team aligned and gives you a clear timeline of what’s been done. You can add notes from the lead detail panel and they stay attached to that lead.

## Why log activities

- **Team visibility** — Anyone with access to Leads can see what was discussed and when.
- **Follow-up** — You can see the last contact date and what was said so you don’t repeat yourself or miss a next step.
- **History** — If a lead returns later or enrolls, you have a record of the journey.

## Adding a note

1. Open the lead by clicking their row on the Leads page.
2. In the lead detail panel, scroll to **Activity Timeline**.
3. Choose an **Activity type**:
   - **Note** — General note or comment
   - **Call** — Phone call
   - **Email** — Email exchange
   - **Meeting** — In-person or virtual meeting
   - **Other** — Anything else (e.g. text, form response)
4. Type your **Content** in the text box (what was discussed, outcome, next steps, etc.).
5. Click **Add Note**.

The note appears in the activity list with the type, date and time, your name, and the content. You can add as many notes as you need; the most recent appear at the top.

## Where notes appear

All notes for a lead are listed in the **Activity Timeline** section of the lead detail panel. Each entry shows the activity type, when it was added, who added it, and the full content. The Leads table also shows a **Notes** column with the count of notes for each lead so you can see at a glance which leads have the most activity.

Notes are tied to the lead and visible to other program owners and instructors in your organization. They are not sent to the student; they are for internal use only.
