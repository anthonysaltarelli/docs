When you click a lead in the table, the lead detail panel opens. It shows everything about that lead and lets you update their status and add notes.

## What the panel shows

At the top you’ll see:

- **Name** and current **status** (Active, Converted, or Lost)
- **Email** and **phone** (click to email or call)
- **Program / course** and **cohort** (if they chose one)
- **Lead value** (program tuition when available) and **created** date

Further down you’ll find status management, status history, activity timeline (notes), waitlist management, and (for cart abandonment leads) cart abandonment emails.

## Lead statuses

- **Active** — You’re still working this lead or they haven’t enrolled or purchased yet.
- **Converted** — They enrolled in a cohort or completed a course purchase. You can also mark a lead Converted manually if they signed up outside the platform.
- **Lost** — They’re no longer pursuing (e.g. chose another program or decided not to enroll).

## How to update status

1. In the lead detail panel, find the **Status Management** section.
2. Choose the new status from the **Status** dropdown (Active, Converted, or Lost).
3. Optionally add **Notes** to explain the change (e.g. “Enrolled in Fall 2026 cohort” or “Went with another provider”).
4. Click **Update Status**.

The lead’s status updates immediately and a new entry is added to **Status History** so you can see who changed it, when, and any notes. If you mark a lead Converted, it’s a good idea to add a short note so the rest of your team knows what happened.

## Status history

The **Status History** section lists every status change for this lead: the previous and new status, the date and time, and who made the change (if they’re a user in your organization). Any notes entered when updating status appear here too. This gives you a clear record of how the lead moved through your pipeline.
