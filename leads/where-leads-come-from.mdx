Leads in your list come from two places: when someone submits an information request on your public page, or when someone signs in and goes to checkout but does not complete payment.

## Information request form

When a prospective student uses **Request Program Information** on your public program or cohort page:

- They enter their name, email, and phone and submit the form.
- They receive a confirmation email that their request was sent.
- Your organization receives a notification email with their contact details and the program or cohort they asked about.
- The request appears as a new lead in [Program Dashboard → Leads](https://firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/information-requests).

You can then follow up by phone or email and update their status and notes in the lead panel.

## Cart abandonment

When someone is signed in and goes to the checkout page for a cohort or a course but leaves without completing payment:

- The system may create a lead (or reuse an existing one from a recent visit) so you can see who showed interest.
- Up to three automated follow-up emails may be sent to remind them to complete enrollment or purchase (see [Cart abandonment emails](/leads/cart-abandonment-emails)).
- The lead appears in your Leads list. If they complete enrollment or purchase later, their lead status is automatically updated to Converted and any remaining follow-up emails are cancelled.

This helps you see who started checkout and gives the platform a chance to re-engage them before you need to reach out manually.
