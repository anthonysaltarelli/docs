When a lead is created from cart abandonment (someone signed in and went to checkout but didn’t complete), the platform can send up to three automated follow-up emails to encourage them to come back and finish. You can see the status of these emails in the lead detail panel.

## What you see in the lead panel

For leads that came from cart abandonment, the **Cart Abandonment Emails** section in the lead detail panel shows:

- **Email 1, 2, and 3** — Each step has a status and (when applicable) when it was scheduled and when it was sent.
- **Status** — For example: scheduled, sent, delivered, failed, or cancelled/skipped (if the student enrolled or purchased before that email went out).

This lets you see at a glance whether the emails were sent and whether the student completed enrollment or purchase (in which case remaining emails are marked as cancelled or skipped).

## How the emails work

After someone leaves checkout without completing, the system schedules up to three follow-up emails at set intervals. Each email is sent automatically; you don’t have to do anything. The emails remind the student about the program or course they were looking at and give them a link back to checkout. If the student completes enrollment or purchases the course before a scheduled email is sent, that email and any later ones are automatically cancelled so they don’t receive extra reminders after they’ve already signed up.

## When emails are cancelled

As soon as the student completes cohort enrollment or course purchase, the platform:

- Marks any remaining scheduled cart abandonment emails for that lead as cancelled or skipped.
- Updates the lead status to Converted (see [What updates automatically](/leads/automatic-updates)).

So the student gets follow-up only while they haven’t completed; once they enroll or purchase, no more of these emails are sent. You can still see in the lead panel that those steps were skipped because they converted.
