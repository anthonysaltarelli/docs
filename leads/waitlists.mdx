A lead can be on one or more cohort waitlists. From the lead detail panel you can see which cohorts they’re already on and add them to another cohort’s waitlist using their name, email, and phone.

## Waitlist management in the lead panel

When you open a lead, scroll to **Waitlist Management**. You’ll see:

- **Currently in waitlists** — A list of cohorts this lead is already on, with cohort name, program name, and when they were added.
- **Add to cohort waitlist** — A dropdown to choose another cohort and a button to add them.

## Adding a lead to a waitlist

1. Open the lead from the Leads table.
2. In **Waitlist Management**, open the **Add to Cohort Waitlist** dropdown.
3. Choose the cohort you want. Only cohorts that accept waitlist signups appear (e.g. open, full, or waitlist-open cohorts).
4. Click **Add to Waitlist**.

The lead’s name, email, and phone from the lead record are used for the waitlist entry. If the lead is already on that cohort’s waitlist, you’ll see a message and the system won’t create a duplicate. After adding, the cohort appears under “Currently in waitlists” and the lead will show the waitlist indicator (e.g. star) in the main Leads table.

## Which cohorts appear in the dropdown

Only cohorts that are in a lifecycle state that allows waitlist signups are listed—for example open, full, or waitlist open. If you don’t see a cohort, it may be in planning or closed, or it may not have waitlist enabled. You can manage the cohort’s lifecycle and waitlist settings from the Cohorts area of the program dashboard.

## Seeing waitlist status on the Leads table

In the main Leads table, a star or badge next to a lead’s name means they are on at least one waitlist for your organization. Open the lead to see exactly which cohorts they’re on.
