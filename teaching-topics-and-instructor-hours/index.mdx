This guide explains how to track what is taught in your sessions, who teaches it, and how to run reports on instructor hours for CME credit, recertification, or internal records. Everything is organized around **Teaching Topics**, **Cohorts**, **Session Segments**, and the **Instructor Hours** report.

## What's in this section

| Guide | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| [Teaching Topics](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/teaching-topics) | Your organization's list of subject areas: create, edit, reorder, deactivate, and why they matter |
| [Session segments (Manage Teaching)](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/session-segments) | Recording what was taught in each session: topics, duration, instructors, co-teaching, notes, and history |
| [Instructor Hours report](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/instructor-hours-report) | Running and exporting the report by cohort, instructor, topic, and date for CME and recertification |

## Where to find things in the app

- **Teaching Topics:** [Program Dashboard → Settings → Teaching Topics](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/settings/teaching-topics). Only **program owners** can access this page.
- **Instructor Hours:** [Program Dashboard → Instructor Hours](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/instructor-hours). Program owners and instructors can view and run the report.
- **Session teaching (segments):** [Program Dashboard → Cohorts](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) → open a cohort → **Schedule** tab → **Manage Session** on a session → **Teaching** tab.

## Who can access what

- **Program owner:** Can manage Teaching Topics (create, edit, reorder, deactivate). Can record session segments and run the Instructor Hours report.
- **Instructor:** Can record session segments and run the Instructor Hours report. Cannot access Settings → Teaching Topics.

## Quick Reference: How It Fits Together

1. **Set up Teaching Topics** — In Settings → Teaching Topics, create the subject areas your organization uses (e.g. Airway, Trauma, Cardiac).
2. **Build cohorts and sessions** — Create your cohorts and their session schedule as usual.
3. **Record what was taught** — For each session, open Manage Session → Teaching tab. Add segments (topic + duration + instructors) so they add up to the session length.
4. **Run and export the report** — Go to Instructor Hours, set filters if needed, click Generate Report, and use Export CSV when you need a file for CME or recertification.
