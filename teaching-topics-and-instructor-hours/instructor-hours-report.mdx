The Instructor Hours report shows teaching hours credited to each instructor, broken down by [teaching topic](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/teaching-topics). You can filter by cohort, instructor, topic, and date range, then export to CSV for CME submissions, recertification, or your own records.

## Where to find it

In the Program Dashboard, go to **Instructor Hours** (in the Operations section of the sidebar).

[**Program Dashboard → Instructor Hours**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/instructor-hours)

Program owners and instructors can view and run the report.

## What it shows

A report of teaching hours credited to each instructor, broken down by teaching topic. You see totals per instructor and per topic, and you can expand the view to see which sessions contributed (session title, date, hours, cohort, and program).

## Filters

You can narrow the report by:

- **Cohort** — one cohort or all.
- **Instructor** — one instructor or all.
- **Teaching topic** — one topic or all.
- **Start date** and **End date** — only sessions that start in this date range are included.

Choose your filters and click **Generate Report** to run it. Cancelled sessions are never included.

## How hours are calculated

Hours come from the [session segments](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/session-segments) you set up in Manage Teaching. For each segment, every instructor assigned to that segment is credited with the full duration of that segment. So co-teaching a 4-hour segment gives each of those instructors 4 hours in the report.

## Export

Use **Export CSV** to download the report for CME submissions, recertification, or your own records.
