Session segments let you record what was actually taught in a session—which topics, for how long, and by whom. You manage them in the **Teaching** tab after opening **Manage Session** for a session.

## Cohorts and sessions: where to start

**Cohorts** are your specific classes or program runs—for example "EMT Basic Fall 2024". Each cohort has a **schedule** of sessions.

**Sessions** are the individual class meetings: each has a date, time, location, and type (e.g. Lecture, Skills Lab).

To manage teaching for a session: go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts), open the cohort you want, then open the **Schedule** tab. On the session you want to work with, click **Manage Session**, then open the **Teaching** tab.

## What a segment is

A session can be split into one or more **segments**. Each segment represents a block of time in that session and has:

- **Teaching topic** — chosen from your organization's [Teaching Topics](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/teaching-topics) list.
- **Duration** — how long that topic was taught (e.g. 4 hours).
- **Instructors** — who taught that segment. You can assign more than one instructor to a segment (co-teaching).

## How to use it

- Add or remove segments so the session is broken into the blocks that match what actually happened in class.
- For each segment, choose a **topic** and **duration**. The segment durations should add up to the total session length.
- Assign **instructors** to each segment. The system will treat the instructor with the most teaching time in that session as the primary instructor.
- You can add optional **notes** per segment and an optional **change reason** when you save. The change reason and **History** tab help you keep an audit trail of who changed what and when.
- To see past changes, use the **History** tab in the same Manage Session panel.

## Co-teaching

If you assign multiple instructors to one segment, each of them receives full credit for that segment's duration in the [Instructor Hours report](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/instructor-hours-report) (e.g. a 4-hour segment with two instructors gives each instructor 4 hours).
