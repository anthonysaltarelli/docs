Teaching topics are your organization's list of subject areas you use when recording what was taught in a session—for example "Airway Management", "Trauma", or "Cardiac Care". This list is shared across all your programs and cohorts.

## Where to find them

In the Program Dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Teaching Topics**.

[**Program Dashboard → Settings → Teaching Topics**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/settings/teaching-topics)

Only **program owners** can access this page. Instructors can use the list when recording session segments but cannot create, edit, or reorder topics.

## What you can do

- **Create** a topic: give it a clear name and, if you like, a short description.
- **Edit** a topic: change its name or description.
- **Reorder** topics: use the up/down arrows so the list appears in the order you prefer when assigning topics to sessions.
- **Deactivate** a topic: move it to the inactive section so it no longer appears when you add new session segments. Past sessions that used this topic are unchanged.
- **Reactivate** a topic: move it back from the inactive section so you can use it again for new segments.

## Why they matter

Teaching topics are the only options you can assign to session segments. They also drive how the [Instructor Hours report](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/instructor-hours-report) is broken down by topic, so setting them up well makes reporting and CME tracking straightforward.
