This section covers everything you need to collect payments from students and manage money on the platform: connecting Stripe, configuring how students pay per cohort, creating and managing invoices and balances, using promo codes (coupons), and processing refunds.

## What's in this section

| Guide | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| [Stripe Connect](/payment-settings/stripe-connect) | Setting up and verifying your Stripe account, what to expect during onboarding, and enabling payment acceptance |
| [Payment configurations](/payment-settings/payment-configurations) | Per–program-offering options: full payment, deposits, balance due dates, and free offerings |
| [Invoices and balances](/payment-settings/invoices-and-balances) | Creating invoices, payment links, balance due, reminder emails, and manual balance adjustments |
| [Coupons (promo codes)](/payment-settings/coupons) | Creating and managing promo codes for program offerings and courses |
| [Refunds](/payment-settings/refunds) | When and how to issue refunds, partial vs full, and how they affect balances |

## Requirements

- **Subscription:** Payment processing is available on **all plans**. The free **Starter** plan can accept payments at a 5% transaction fee; **Growth** and **Scale** offer more program offerings and lower transaction fees.
- **Role:** Only **program owners** can create or manage the Stripe Connect account and toggle “Accept Online Payments.” Instructors can view payment account status and manage enrollments, invoices, and refunds.
- **Stripe Connect:** You must complete Stripe Connect onboarding (identity, business, banking, and any tax information) before you can turn on “Accept Online Payments.”

## Where to find Payment Settings

Go to [**Program Dashboard → Settings → Payments**](https://firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/settings/payments) to:

- Toggle **Accept Online Payments** for your organization
- Set up or complete **Stripe Connect** onboarding
- Configure **Invoice reminder** schedules (when reminder emails are sent relative to due dates)

Per-offering payment options (full payment, deposit, balance due reference) are configured when you create or edit a [**Program Offering**](https://firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/program-offerings).
