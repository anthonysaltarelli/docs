**Recurring patterns** define when and where your cohort meets on a repeating basis—for example "Every Monday 9:00 AM–5:00 PM at Main Campus – Lecture" or "Every Wednesday 6:00 PM–9:00 PM – Virtual – Skills Lab." You use these patterns to generate the actual sessions on the cohort’s calendar.

## What a pattern includes

Each pattern has:

- **Day of week** — Monday through Sunday.
- **Name** — A short label (e.g. "Lecture Day," "Lab Night").
- **Start time** and **End time** — When that block starts and ends.
- **Location** — A physical location from your organization’s locations, or **Virtual** if the session is online.
- **Session types** — One or more types (e.g. Lecture, Laboratory, Skills Practice, Clinical, Examination). These help you and students see what kind of session it is.

You can add multiple patterns to one cohort—e.g. one for Monday lecture and one for Wednesday lab—so the generated schedule reflects all recurring blocks.

## Where to add or edit patterns

You can manage recurring patterns in two places:

1. **When creating a cohort** — On the create-cohort flow, in the schedule section, you add one or more patterns before saving. See [Creating a cohort](/cohort-management/creating-a-cohort).

2. **When editing a cohort** — Open the cohort, go to the **Overview** tab, and in **Cohort Details** expand **Schedule**. There you can add new patterns, edit existing ones (day, name, times, location, session types), or remove patterns. See [Overview and editing](/cohort-management/overview-and-editing).

Changes to patterns do not automatically change sessions that were already generated. If you add or change patterns and want the calendar to match, you may need to regenerate sessions from the Schedule tab (the app will warn you if existing sessions would be replaced).

## How patterns become sessions

Patterns are only a template. The actual sessions on the calendar are created when you use **Generate schedule** (or the equivalent button) on the cohort’s **Schedule** tab. That process creates one session for each occurrence of each pattern between the cohort’s start and end date. After that, you can still edit or cancel individual sessions. See [Schedule and sessions](/cohort-management/schedule-and-sessions).
