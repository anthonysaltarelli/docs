When you create a new cohort, you choose the program offering, set dates and capacity, define the recurring schedule (patterns), and optionally assign instructors.

## Where to start

Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and click **Create New Cohort**, or open [**Create New Cohort**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts/create) directly.

## What you’ll set

### Basic information

- **Cohort name** — e.g. "EMT Basic Fall 2024." This is what you and students see.
- **Program offering** — The offering (program and pricing) this cohort is for. Only active offerings appear.
- **Start date** and **End date** — When the cohort runs.
- **Enrollment deadline** — Last date students can enroll (if you use it).
- **Enrollment capacity** — Maximum number of students (optional).

### Schedule (recurring patterns)

You define one or more **recurring patterns** that describe when class meets—for example "Every Monday 9:00 AM–5:00 PM at Main Campus – Lecture." Each pattern has:

- **Day of week** — Monday through Sunday.
- **Name** — Short label (e.g. "Lecture Day").
- **Start time** and **End time**.
- **Location** — A location from your organization, or virtual.
- **Session types** — e.g. Lecture, Skills Lab, Clinical (one or more per pattern).

These patterns don’t create individual sessions yet. After you save the cohort, you open it, go to the **Schedule** tab, and use **Generate schedule** (or similar) to create sessions from the patterns for the cohort’s date range. See [Recurring patterns](/cohort-management/recurring-patterns) and [Schedule and sessions](/cohort-management/schedule-and-sessions).

### Instructors

You can assign instructors to the cohort when creating it. They’ll be available when you assign teaching to sessions later.

## After you create the cohort

Once the cohort is created, you’re taken to its detail page. Next steps:

1. Open the **Schedule** tab and **generate sessions** from your recurring patterns so the calendar is filled.
2. Optionally invite students or open enrollment (via the cohort’s lifecycle state and your program/offering settings).
3. Use the **Waitlist**, **Students**, **Outcomes**, and **Feedback** tabs as the cohort runs.
