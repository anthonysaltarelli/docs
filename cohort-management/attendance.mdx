You can record attendance for each session so you know who was there and who was late, absent, or excused.

## Where to take attendance

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Open the **Schedule** tab.
3. Click the session you want (or use the action for that session), then choose **Take attendance** (or the equivalent).

A panel or page opens listing enrolled students. For each student you select a status and can add optional notes.

## Attendance statuses

- **Present** — The student attended.
- **Late** — The student attended but arrived late.
- **Absent** — The student did not attend and was not excused.
- **Excused** — The student did not attend but was excused (e.g. illness, emergency).

You can add **notes** per student (e.g. "Left at 2 PM" or "Doctor’s note on file"). Notes are for your records and are typically not shown to students.

## Saving attendance

After you set each student’s status (and optional notes), save. The attendance is stored for that session. You can reopen **Take attendance** for the same session later to change or add statuses if needed.

## Who sees attendance

Attendance is used by your organization for records and reporting. Whether students can see their own attendance (e.g. on their dashboard or in a transcript) depends on your setup; the app may show it in the student’s schedule or profile where applicable.
