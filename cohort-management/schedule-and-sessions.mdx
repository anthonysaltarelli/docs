The **Schedule** tab shows your cohort’s calendar of sessions. You first generate sessions from your [recurring patterns](/cohort-management/recurring-patterns), then you can open any session to manage it or take attendance.

## Where to find the schedule

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open a cohort.
2. Click the **Schedule** tab.

You’ll see a calendar view of sessions (month or other views, depending on the app). Cancelled sessions may be hidden or shown with a cancelled state.

## Generating sessions from patterns

If the cohort has no sessions yet but has [recurring patterns](/cohort-management/recurring-patterns) set, the Schedule tab will show an option to **Generate schedule** (or similar). Click it to create sessions for every occurrence of each pattern between the cohort’s start and end date.

If sessions already exist, generating again may replace them. The app will show a warning so you can confirm. Use this when you’ve added or changed patterns and want the calendar to match.

## Opening a session: Manage Session and Take attendance

When you click a session on the calendar (or use a session list if available), you can:

- **Manage Session** — Opens a panel where you can:
  - View an **overview** of the session.
  - Edit **details** (title, description, date, time, location, type, notes, cancellation).
  - Manage **teaching** (session segments: topics, duration, instructors).
  - **Assign lessons** (link lessons from the cohort’s courses to this session).
  - View **history** of teaching changes.

- **Take attendance** — Opens a separate flow where you mark each enrolled student as Present, Late, Absent, or Excused and save.

You can use **Manage Session** to change the date or time of a single session, cancel it, or add teaching segments and lessons. You don’t have to regenerate the whole schedule for one-off changes.

## When to generate vs when to edit

- **Generate schedule** — Use when you first set up the cohort or when you’ve changed recurring patterns and want the calendar to reflect them for the full date range.
- **Edit a session** — Use when one date is different (e.g. a make-up class), when you need to cancel one day, or when you’re only changing title, location, or notes for a single session.
