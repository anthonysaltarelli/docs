---

The **Outcomes** tab on a cohort is where you record and view outcome records for students in that cohort—for example exam results, certifications, completions, or withdrawals. You can add one record at a time or use **Record outcomes in bulk** for many students at once.

For a full guide to outcomes (where to set them, outcome types, bulk recording, and the main Results & Certifications page), see the **Outcomes** section: [Outcomes overview](/outcomes), [Results & Certifications](/outcomes/results-and-certifications), [Outcome Types](/outcomes/outcome-types), [Recording in bulk](/outcomes/recording-in-bulk).

## Where to find the Outcomes tab

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Click the **Outcomes** tab.

You’ll see a table of outcome records for this cohort (student, type, subtype, date, result, score, and actions).

## Adding one outcome record

Click **Record Outcome** (or **Add Outcome Record**). Choose the student (from this cohort’s enrolled students), outcome type, subtype, date, result (e.g. pass/fail or Completed/Withdrawn), and optional score and notes. Save. The record appears in the table.

## Recording outcomes in bulk

Click **Record outcomes in bulk** to add many records in one flow—for example one exam date and one outcome type, then set each student’s result or score. This is useful after a cohort-wide exam or assessment. For step-by-step instructions, see [Recording outcomes in bulk](/outcomes/recording-in-bulk).

## Viewing and editing

From each row you can **Edit** (change date, subtype, result, score, or notes), **View History** (see who changed what and when), or **Delete** (program owners only).
