The **Outcomes** tab is where you record and view **outcome records** for students in the cohort—for example exam results, certifications, or other milestones. This gives you a single place to see what each student has achieved in this run.

## Where to find outcomes

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Click the **Outcomes** tab.

You’ll see a table of outcome records (student, type, subtype, date, result, score, and actions). You can add one record at a time or use **Record outcomes in bulk** if the app supports it.

## Adding an outcome record

Click **Add Outcome Record** (or the equivalent). You’ll choose:

- **Student** — Who the outcome is for (from this cohort’s enrolled students).
- **Type** — e.g. Exam, Certification, or other outcome types your organization uses.
- **Subtype** — More specific category if available (e.g. type of exam or credential).
- **Date** — When the outcome occurred.
- **Result** — Pass/fail or other result, depending on type.
- **Score** — Numeric score if applicable.

Save. The record appears in the Outcomes table.

## Recording outcomes in bulk

If **Record outcomes in bulk** (or similar) is available, you can enter multiple outcome records in one flow—for example for one exam date and one outcome type, selecting multiple students and their results or scores. This is useful after a cohort-wide exam or assessment.

## Viewing and editing outcome records

The table shows all outcome records for the cohort. Columns typically include student name, outcome type, subtype, date, result, and score. From the row you can usually **edit** a record (change result, score, or date) or open **history** to see past changes, depending on the app.
