You can permanently delete a cohort when it has no enrolled students and no blocking related data (such as waitlist entries or application submissions). Deleting a cohort cannot be undone.

## Where to find it

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Click the **Danger Zone** tab (alongside Overview, Students, Waitlist, Outcomes, Schedule, and Feedback).

The Danger Zone section shows whether you can delete the cohort and what to do if you cannot.

## When you can delete

You’ll see a **Delete cohort** button only when:

- The cohort has **no enrolled students** (zero enrollments).
- The cohort has no other blocking data (e.g. application submissions or waitlist entries tied to it).

If both are true, you can click **Delete cohort**, confirm in the dialog, and the cohort will be permanently removed. You’ll be taken back to the Cohorts list.

## When you cannot delete

### The cohort has enrolled students

If the cohort has one or more enrollments, the Danger Zone will explain that the cohort cannot be deleted because it has enrollments. You must **transfer those students to another cohort first**.

1. Open the **Students** tab for this cohort.
2. Use the transfer action for each student to move them to another cohort of the same program offering.
3. After all students are transferred, return to the **Danger Zone** tab. If there are no other blocking items, the **Delete cohort** option will appear.

See [Students and invites](/cohort-management/students-and-invites) for how to transfer students.

### The cohort has other related data

Sometimes the system will not allow delete because the cohort still has related data (for example, application submissions or waitlist entries). In that case, the Danger Zone or an error message will tell you to remove or resolve those first. Clear or resolve the items it mentions (e.g. in the Waitlist tab or Applications), then check the Danger Zone again.
