The **Students** tab shows everyone enrolled in the cohort. From there you can invite new students (one at a time or in bulk) and transfer a student to another cohort.

## Where to find students

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Click the **Students** tab.

You’ll see a list of enrolled students (name, email, and other details depending on the app). You can search or filter the list.

## Inviting students

If your organization uses **invites**, you can send enrollment invites so the student can complete signup and join the cohort.

- **Single invite** — Use the option to invite one student (e.g. enter email and send invite).
- **Bulk invite** — Use **Invite students** or **Bulk invite** to add multiple emails (e.g. paste a list or upload). Each receives an invite link. Until they accept, they may appear as "Pending invites" on the Overview tab or in the Students area.

After the student accepts the invite and completes any required steps, they become an enrolled student and show in the Students list.

## Pending invites

Invites that haven’t been accepted yet may be shown in the **Overview** tab under "Pending invites" or in the Students tab. You can resend an invite or remove it if the person is no longer expected to enroll.

### Resend an invite manually

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Open the **Students** tab.
3. In the **Pending invites** section, find the invite you want to resend.
4. Click **Resend** (or the resend action) for that invite. The student will receive the invite email again with the same link.

### Automatic reminders

If a student doesn’t accept the invite, the platform sends reminder emails automatically: the first reminder 2 days after the initial invite, then at least 2 days between any further reminders, up to 10 reminders per invite. You can still resend an invite manually from the pending list if you want; for routine follow-up, the automatic reminders mean you don’t have to.

## Transferring a student to another cohort

If a student should move to a different cohort (e.g. different start date or location), use **Transfer** (or the equivalent) for that student. You choose the destination cohort and confirm. The student’s enrollment moves to the new cohort; they lose access to the old cohort’s schedule and materials and gain access to the new one. Any history (e.g. payments, outcomes) is handled according to the app’s rules—check the transfer flow for details.
