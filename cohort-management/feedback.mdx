The **Feedback** tab brings together student feedback for the cohort: NPS (Net Promoter Score), session surveys, category ratings, written reviews, and session survey history. Use it to see how the cohort is going and what students thought of specific sessions or the program as a whole.

## Where to find feedback

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Click the **Feedback** tab.

The first time you open it, the app may load detailed feedback (ratings, reviews, surveys). You’ll then see summary cards and sections described below.

## What the Feedback tab shows

### NPS (Net Promoter Score)

If your organization collects NPS, you’ll see a summary such as promoters vs detractors and the NPS score for the cohort or offering. This reflects how likely students are to recommend the program.

### Session surveys

After sessions, students may be asked to rate the session (e.g. 1–5) and optionally leave a comment. The Feedback tab can show:

- Total number of session survey responses.
- Average session rating.
- **Recent session surveys** — A list of sessions with response count and average rating. Expanding a session may show individual responses and comments.

Use this to see which sessions were rated highly and where students left comments.

### Category ratings

If feedback is collected by category (e.g. content, instructor, materials), you may see a breakdown: each category with average rating and number of ratings. This helps you see strengths and areas to improve.

### Student reviews

When students complete the program (or at a set time), they may submit a **review** with an overall rating and optional public and private feedback. The Feedback tab can list these reviews with:

- Student name (or anonymous, depending on setup)
- Date submitted
- Status (e.g. submitted, published)
- Overall rating (e.g. stars)
- Public review text (if any)
- Private feedback (for your eyes only)
- Cohort improvement suggestion (if the student left one)

Reviews help you understand the full experience and can be published to your public profile if you use that feature.

### Session survey history

A section may list recent sessions with survey response counts and average ratings, and let you expand to read comments. This is the same session-level data as above, in a history or list form.

## Using feedback

- **During the cohort** — Check session surveys and comments to adjust pacing, content, or logistics.
- **After the cohort** — Use NPS, category ratings, and reviews for program improvement and for marketing (e.g. published reviews).
- **Private vs public** — Private feedback and cohort suggestions are for internal use; public review text can be shown on your organization’s page if you enable it.
