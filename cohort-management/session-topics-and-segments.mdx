Session **segments** let you record what was actually taught in a session—which topics, for how long, and by which instructors. That supports instructor hours for CME or recertification and gives you a clear record of what was covered.

## Where it lives

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Open the **Schedule** tab and click the session.
3. Click **Manage Session**, then open the **Teaching** tab.

In the Teaching tab you add one or more **segments**. Each segment has a **teaching topic** (from your organization’s topic list), a **duration**, and **instructor(s)**. Segment durations should add up to the total session length.

## Why use segments

- **Instructor hours** — Time per topic and per instructor is used for the [Instructor Hours report](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/instructor-hours-report) (e.g. for CME or recertification).
- **Audit trail** — You can see what was taught when and by whom. The **History** tab in the same Manage Session panel shows past changes to teaching assignments.
- **Co-teaching** — You can assign more than one instructor to a segment; each gets full credit for that segment’s duration in the report.

## Full details on segments and topics

For a full walkthrough of segments (how to add them, set duration, assign instructors, and use the History tab), see [Session segments (Manage Teaching)](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/session-segments).

To manage the list of teaching topics your organization can use in segments, see [Teaching topics](/teaching-topics-and-instructor-hours/teaching-topics).
