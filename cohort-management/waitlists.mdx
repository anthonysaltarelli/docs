Each cohort can have its own **waitlist**: a list of people who want to enroll when a spot opens. From the cohort’s **Waitlist** tab you add contacts, see who’s on the list, download the list, and send an email to waitlisted people.

## Where to find the cohort waitlist

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Click the **Waitlist** tab.

You’ll see a table of everyone on the waitlist (contact name, email, phone, when they joined, status) and actions such as **Add to waitlist**, **Download CSV**, and **Email Waitlist**.

## Adding someone to the waitlist

Click **Add to waitlist**. Enter:

- First name and last name
- Email
- Phone (if you use it)
- Consent for outreach (if required)

Save. They appear in the waitlist table. If your organization also uses **Leads**, you can add a lead to this cohort’s waitlist from the lead’s detail panel—see [Waitlists (Leads)](/leads/waitlists).

## Viewing the waitlist

The table shows each contact’s name, email, phone, date they joined the waitlist, and status (e.g. active, contacted, enrolled). Use this to see who’s waiting and who you’ve already contacted or enrolled.

## Downloading the waitlist

Use **Download CSV** to export the waitlist (e.g. names, emails, phone numbers) so you can use it in a spreadsheet or for external outreach. The exact columns depend on the app.

## Emailing the waitlist

**Email Waitlist** sends an email to people on the waitlist (often only those who haven’t been contacted yet or who are still active). You may be able to:

- Send a **test email** to your own address first to preview the message.
- Then send to all eligible contacts.

While emails are sending, the app may show progress (e.g. "Sending… X of Y sent"). After sending, contacted status may update so you don’t email the same people again by mistake.

## Cohort vs leads waitlist

- **Cohort waitlist** (this page) — The list for *this* cohort. You add contacts here or from the Leads area.
- **Leads waitlists** — From a lead’s profile you can see which cohort waitlists they’re on and add them to another cohort’s waitlist. See [Waitlists](/leads/waitlists).
