You can edit any session’s details or cancel it so students and the schedule reflect the change. Editing and cancelling are done from **Manage Session** on the cohort’s Schedule tab.

## Opening session details

1. Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) and open the cohort.
2. Open the **Schedule** tab and click the session you want.
3. Click **Manage Session** (or the equivalent), then open the **Details** tab (or the edit view that shows title, date, time, location, and cancellation).

## What you can edit

- **Title** — Name of the session (e.g. "Week 1 – Monday").
- **Description** — Optional description for students.
- **Date and time** — Start and end date and time. If the session spans more than one day, you can turn on a multi-day option and set end date/time.
- **Session type** — e.g. Lecture, Skills Lab, Clinical, Examination.
- **Location** — Physical location or virtual. If virtual, you can enter a virtual meeting link.
- **Notes** — Internal notes (typically not shown to students).

Save your changes when you’re done. The calendar and student schedule will update.

## Cancelling a session

In the same **Manage Session → Details** (or edit) view:

1. Turn on the option to **cancel** the session (e.g. "Session is cancelled" or similar).
2. Optionally enter a **cancellation reason** (e.g. "Instructor illness" or "Weather"). The reason can be shown to students so they know why the session was cancelled.
3. Save.

Cancelled sessions usually still appear on the calendar or schedule but are clearly marked as cancelled. Students see the cancelled state and the reason if you entered one. Cancelled sessions are often excluded from attendance or teaching reports, depending on the app.

## Deleting a session

If the app supports deleting a session (e.g. a "Delete session" button in Manage Session or Details), that removes the session from the schedule entirely. Use this only when the session was created by mistake or should no longer exist. Deleting is different from cancelling: cancelled sessions remain on the schedule as cancelled; deleted ones are gone.
