The cohort list is your starting point. From there you open a cohort and use the **Overview** tab to see key numbers and edit basic information and schedule.

## Opening the cohort list

Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts). You’ll see all cohorts for your organization. You can filter by status, program offering, or type (program vs event). Click a cohort row to open it.

## The Overview tab

When you open a cohort, the default tab is **Overview**. It shows:

- **Enrolled Students** — How many students are enrolled and, if set, the cohort’s capacity.
- **Revenue** — Total agreed tuition for enrolled students.
- **Collected Revenue** — Actual payments received.
- **Waitlist** — Number of people on the cohort’s waitlist.
- **Average Rating** — From published student reviews.
- **Avg Session Rating** — From session surveys.

Below the metrics you’ll see **Cohort Details** with collapsible sections:

- **Basic Information** — Cohort name, start and end date, enrollment capacity, and **lifecycle state** (e.g. Planning, Open for Enrollment, In Progress, Completed, Archived).
- **Schedule** — The recurring schedule (e.g. which days and times). If you use structured patterns, they’re listed here. You can add, edit, or remove patterns in this section.

Editing any of these fields and saving updates the cohort. Changing the lifecycle state (e.g. from Planning to Open for Enrollment) affects how the cohort appears to students and whether they can enroll or join the waitlist.

## Editing a cohort

1. Open the cohort from the [Cohorts list](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts).
2. On the **Overview** tab, expand **Cohort Details**.
3. Expand **Basic Information** or **Schedule** and change the fields you need.
4. Save your changes.

You can change the cohort name, start and end dates, enrollment capacity, and lifecycle state in Basic Information. In Schedule you manage the recurring patterns (days, times, locations, session types) that are used to generate sessions on the Schedule tab.
