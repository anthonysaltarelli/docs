A **cohort** is a specific run of a program—for example "EMT Basic Fall 2024" or "Spring Weekend Intensive." From the cohort you manage enrolled students, the waitlist, the schedule of sessions, attendance, outcomes, and feedback.

## Where to find cohorts

Go to [**Program Dashboard → Cohorts**](https://www.firstrespondershub.com/program-dashboard/cohorts) to see all your cohorts. Use **Create New Cohort** to start a new run, or click a cohort to open it.

Inside a cohort you’ll see six tabs: **Overview**, **Students**, **Waitlist**, **Outcomes**, **Schedule**, and **Feedback**. Each tab focuses on one area of cohort management.

## What you can do

| Topic | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| [Overview and editing](/cohort-management/overview-and-editing) | Cohort list, opening a cohort, the Overview tab (metrics, cohort details, lifecycle), and editing name, dates, capacity, and schedule. |
| [Creating a cohort](/cohort-management/creating-a-cohort) | Step-by-step: name, program offering, dates, capacity, recurring patterns, and instructors. |
| [Recurring patterns](/cohort-management/recurring-patterns) | What patterns are (e.g. "Every Monday 9–5 at Main Campus – Lecture") and where to add or edit them. |
| [Schedule and sessions](/cohort-management/schedule-and-sessions) | The Schedule tab, generating sessions from patterns, and opening Manage Session or Take attendance. |
| [Editing and cancelling sessions](/cohort-management/editing-and-cancelling-sessions) | Changing session details (date, time, location, type) and marking a session as cancelled. |
| [Session topics and segments](/cohort-management/session-topics-and-segments) | Recording what was taught in each session (topics, duration, instructors) via the Teaching tab. |
| [Attendance](/cohort-management/attendance) | Taking attendance for a session: Present, Late, Absent, Excused. |
| [Waitlists](/cohort-management/waitlists) | The cohort Waitlist tab: adding contacts, viewing the list, downloading CSV, and emailing the waitlist. |
| [Students and invites](/cohort-management/students-and-invites) | Enrolled students, inviting students (including bulk invite), and transferring to another cohort. |
| [Outcomes](/outcomes) | Recording and viewing outcomes (e.g. exam results, certifications)—from the cohort Outcomes tab or the main Results & Certifications page; includes outcome types and bulk recording. |
| [Feedback](/cohort-management/feedback) | NPS, session surveys, category ratings, student reviews, and session survey history. |

Start with [Overview and editing](/cohort-management/overview-and-editing) to get oriented, or [Creating a cohort](/cohort-management/creating-a-cohort) if you’re setting up a new run.
